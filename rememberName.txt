Without configuration git will ask for your username each time you log in. If you want it to remember this.

1. Go to the repository with a file manager
	You should see a file called .git . If you can't you need to configure the file manager to show hidden files.

2. In .git there is a file called config.
	Open it in a text editor.

3. There is a section called [remote "origin"] this has information about where the data is pushed to.
	Look for the line
		url = https://github.com/719349/TestGitHub

	Put your github username followed by @ between https:// and github
	E.g.
		url = https://andrewstanton94@github.com/719349/TestGitHub
